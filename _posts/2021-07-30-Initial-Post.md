# This is my first post

Here I'd like to test the image  upload and typora.

<img src="../assets/images/2021-07-30/test-image.png" alt="test-image" style="zoom: 25%;" />

I'm getting used to use typora, markdown, and github action for my github page blog. üòÅ

I am working as a Machine Learning Engineer, so the contents will be related to it. But everything I want to write and share can be posted.

I really appreciate to all people who made the tools, like github, typora, vscode, etc., which I am using to distribute [my personal blog](https://yongsubaek.github.io/) **totally free**. 

All details about me will be added while uploading posts.
